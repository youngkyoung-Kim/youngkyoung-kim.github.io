            <h1>Research Overview</h1>
            <p>
                My research focuses on ferroelectric field-effect transistors (FeFETs)
                and oxide semiconductor devices for non-volatile memory and neuromorphic
                computing applications. I am particularly interested in device physics,
                interface engineering, and reliability characteristics such as retention
                and endurance.

            <h2>Current Projects</h2>
            <h3>1. MIFS-Structured IGZO FeFET</h3>
            <p>
                Investigating the impact of gate work function and interlayer (IL) design
                on memory window, retention, and endurance. The project includes
                fabrication of MFS and MIFS FeFETs, P–V and ID–VG characterization,
                and pulse-based program/erase analysis.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Oxide Semiconductor TFTs for Neuromorphic Devices</h3>
            <p>
                Developing a-IGZO / a-ITZO based TFT and FeTFT platforms with stable
                multi-level conductance states. The goal is to emulate synaptic behavior
                such as long-term potentiation (LTP), long-term depression (LTD), and
                paired-pulse facilitation (PPF).
            </p>

            <h3>3. Retention and Endurance Reliability</h3>
            <p>
                Systematic study of retention loss and endurance degradation mechanisms
                in FeFETs. This includes time-dependent read-out, pulse stress tests,
                and modeling of trap-assisted polarization switching.
